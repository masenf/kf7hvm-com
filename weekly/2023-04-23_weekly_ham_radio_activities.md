_Maybe you're looking for [next week's](/weekly/2023-04-30) or [last week's](/weekly/2023-04-09) newsletter_?

... well, two week's ago's newsletter, because 04/16 seems lost in the ether.

## Recap üîÅ

    capture the display. Recording will be posted when I can resync the audio

## Triband Wire Yagi

Markus Hansen, VE7CA [describes how to build and deploy a **triband wire yagi**](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/0111035.pdf) with good performance numbers.  This beam antenna is a **6 wire** antenna which covers **10, 15 & 20 meters** and is 2 elements per band.  This could be deployed in the field for portable ops or permanently installed at a home station.

Try it out and get building!
