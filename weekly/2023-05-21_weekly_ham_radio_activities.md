#### Amateur Radio Field Day - Jun 24

**LCARA** is celebrating its **75th Anniversary** this year with a Field Day
barbeque and operating station at **Willow Grove** park. The event is scheduled
to start at 11:00a with camping available on-site Saturday night for
pre-registered club members.

## Sporadic E

As we get closer to summer we're also entering some **Sporadic E seasonal
conditions**.  We've enjoyed about 3 months of great band conditions on 10
meters through the early portion of 2023 with the rise of Solar Cycle 25 but now
the sun and atmospheric conditions have other ideas.

The web link below will explain what Sporadic E means and how we might enjoy it.
As far as Solar Cycle 25 is concerned, it's not over, it's still heading
upwards.  The lazy band conditions are all a part of the build-up thanks to our
sun.  Working those fleeting signals via sporadic E can be fun on 10 meters but
don't forget about 6 meters.  Put up a 6 meter dipole or vertical and start
listening!
