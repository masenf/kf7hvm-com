### February 8, 2023 - Presentation Night: Homebrew Quad Loop

Brian KJ7OX shares his experience with building and operating _a
vertically oriented, horizontally polarized, rectangular **quad loop for 10
meters**._

With 10m activity increasing, this is a great build to get on the air and
catch some DX, particularly as the solar cycle continues to increase. You
don't need to hold a General class license to get on HF!
