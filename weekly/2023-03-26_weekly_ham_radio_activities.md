## Club Updates

### 75th Anniversary

Look to your left as you enter clubhouse door and you'll find a new wooden sign,
on the Memory Wall, "LCARA 75", to commemorate the club's 75th anniversary this
year.

[![LCARA 75 sign, click to expand](files/2023-03-26_lcara_75_tb.jpeg)](files/2023-03-26_lcara_75.jpg)

Thank you to **Sherrie KF7YPD** and **Rick W7RWA** for your gift to LCARA.

### Gratitude üòä

Thanks to **Rick WA7RPM** for diagnosing the recent issues with the furnace. New
parts ‚öôÔ∏è are on the way, and Brian KJ7OX will install new a new filter, so we can
all breathe a bit easier üå¨Ô∏è.

Thanks to **Brian KJ7OX** for coordinating the repair üîß of the IC-7610 touch screen
with ICOM that was mentioned at the March business meeting (no cost estimate yet ü§û).

Thanks to **Steve K7KO** for adding labels üè∑Ô∏è and organizing the physical stations at the clubhouse!

### Repeater Status

* `147.260 MHz`: Repeater occasionally has trouble with input, so the club is in
  the process of identifying and purchasing a replacement commercial-grade
  repeater antenna.
* `147.100 MHz` / `444.900 MHz`: Repeater has persistent issues transmitting.
  **Earl N3EG** measured a -10dB difference in the received signal compared with
  147.260. More investigation is ongoing, but a replacement antenna will likely
  be needed (all three clubhouse repeaters share one tri-band antenna).

## Instruments of Law & Order and Decency

Brian KJ7OX shares [a bit of lore from some earlier days in the Amateur Radio
Service, written by the well known L. B. Cebik, W4RNL (SK)](https://w8an.net/rettysnitch.html)

Have you ever seen a Wouff-Hong or a Rettysnitch?

With these [ancient tools](https://w8an.net/rettysnitch.html), you too can do
your part to bring decency and order to the airwaves.

## [Online Scanner](/2023/03/24/scanner-back-online) Back Up

After a few months offline, I happy to announce that my time-shifting
multi-channel scanner + recorder is now back on the air, in a new and much improved
location. Thanks to Rick WA7RPM for helping me deploy and test the scanner.

### [üëÇ üëâ scanner.kf7hvm.com üì¢](https://scanner.kf7hvm.com)

The scanner hears most major VHF repeaters in the area from `146.100 MHz` to `147.500 MHz`
and many simplex frequencies. Now you can catch up on repeater traffic or nets that
were missed or keep an ear on things using a smartphone.
