## Recap üîÅ

* 02/01 **Cowlitz County ACS Meeting**

## Solar Cycle 25

**Bryan KJ7OX** shares the following,

With the rise of solar cycle 25 it's time for a little education.  To know where
we are in the current cycle see the attached image plucked from a solar weather
website.  We have several good years of band conditions coming so enjoy!

Along with these band conditions there will be an untold number of amateur radio
operators filling all bands for the next several years day and night from around
the world.  Let's set some good examples and be our best, we never know who's
listening.

Lets begin with 10 meters.  Since 10 meters is likely to be the band most newer
or less experienced hams will start out with on HF we need to set a few basic
ground rules so bad habits don't take on a life of their own. 

1.  Listen and learn.
2. Know your radio, get out the manual and keep it close by.  Newer menu driven radios require ongoing attention and when band conditions get rough you're going to want to change settings for transmit/receive to help make those contacts.
3.  Be courteous and set good examples.
4.  Everyone's listing.
5.  Identify every 10 mins or before!
6.  If you need to tune your antenna, find a clear area to tune/test so as not to interfere with others.  Do not hit the auto-tune button on your radio on top of anyone, especially where you plan to operate.
7.  Ask if the frequency is in use!  I hear so often that some newer hams will just begin calling CQ before asking if the frequency is in use.  You wouldn't like it if someone interfered with you.  Remember, we often only hear one half of the conversation.

You get the idea here so I won't add anything else as it's universal common sense.

Please be aware of how you speak, how you have your transmit audio settings
arranged and one of my pet peeves, "over blown modulation" and distorted audio.
Remember, Less = more!  Do not crank up microphone gain and
processing/compression without going through your radios user manual.  Have
someone get on the air with you to help learn what the limits are.  Don't get
angry if someone critiques you and tells you that you sound bad, you probably do
and it's your fault.  Thank them and ask if they might help you with some
suggestions to sound better, most hams will be happy to provide meaningful
suggestions.

Lastly, see the article ["It's not your mic, it's you!" by Steve Katz
WB2WIK/6](/weekly/files/2023-02-05_its_not_your_mic_its_you.pdf) [PDF]. It also
speaks to what I mentioned above.
