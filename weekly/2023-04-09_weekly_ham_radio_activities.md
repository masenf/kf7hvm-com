## Apr 2023 QST

Stu **K7WF** graciously provided this edition of QST Magazine which can be found
at the front table of the clubhouse.

A notable submission to "Letters From Our Members" (pg 24) labeled
"Suggesting a New Form of Public Service" discusses long-term
memory association of sounds and goes on to suggest Morse Code as a scientific
study aid for long/medium/short term memory and human memory
buffering/association.

Having a hard time picking up the code? Check out "Morse Code Rhythm Patterns
from A to Z" (pg 58) for a musical approach to learning Morse Code.

_Thanks to Brian KJ7OX for providing these pointers._
