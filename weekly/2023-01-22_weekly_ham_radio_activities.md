## Recap üîÅ

* 01/18 **LCARA Business Meeting**

### January VHF Contest

Last Saturday (1/21) W7DG participated in the [**ARRL VHF
Contest**](http://www.arrl.org/january-vhf) at the LCARA clubhouse. There was a
great turnout, and we were operating 3 stations simultaneously throughout most
of the day.

As of Sunday afternoon, the club had amassed 89 contacts across different bands
and modes for a total of 2,754 points, we'll see if that's enough to place.

Thanks to everyone who came by and supported the club.

## Upcoming Events üóì

* 01/25 Wed 19:00 **LCARA Technical Committee** at LCARA clubhouse
* 01/28 - 01/30: [**Winter Field Day**](https://www.winterfieldday.com/) (unofficial)

### 50/50?

At the last business meeting, we decided to bring 50/50 raffles back to the
LCARA Business meetings, and potentially other events. Matt, KD7BBJ, has
graciously agreed to organize the effort, so all you need to do to participate
is bring some cash with you when attending the next LCARA Business meeting on
Wednesday, Feb 15th!

### February 8, 2023 - Presentation Night: Homebrew Quad Loop

Brian KJ7OX shares his experience with building and operating _a
vertically oriented, horizontally polarized, rectangular **quad loop for 10
meters**._

With 10m activity increasing, this is a great build to get on the air and
catch some DX, particularly as the solar cycle continues to increase. You
don't need to hold a General class license to get on HF!
