## Recap üîÅ

* 03/08 Wed NOT LCARA Presentation Night
  * Although no topic was scheduled for presentation, some members did come up to the clubhouse
    only to discover as much in person. My sincere _apologies_ for lack of clarity with regard to
    presentation night.
  * Note that **I will email, announce on net, and post to facebook when
    presentation night will occur**.
  * Only the ACS Meeting (first Wednesday) and LCARA meeting (third Wednesday) are
    regularly scheduled.
  * Presentation night (second Wednesday) and Technical Committee (fourth Wednesday)
    meetings will occur as topics are available and will be announced at least one week
    prior to the event.

the state.

## Club History

Please note the image here.

<img src="files/W7AOB.JPG">


This is a screenshot from a 1930-31 callsign book.  I've highlighted the
callsign **W7AOB Dr. John Nelson** who then lived in Tekoa, WA in Whitman County.
It's important to remember our past club members and their contributions to what
we now enjoy.  W7AOB was an early driving force and one of a few forefathers of
what was to become the Lower Columbia Amateur Radio Association which began in 1948.
It was the disastrous 1948 floods in Longview  which drew hams together in the
interest of the community and as a group and we've maintained this spirit ever
since.

It should also be noted that much of what we have now in the way of new
equipment, how we pay our bills and survive is a direct result of a legacy left
to the LCARA by Dr. John Nelson. Many other hams over the decades have provided
sweat and donations to keep our club going.  Here and now, a big thanks goes out
to those members who work on keeping the club going.

## An HF Primer

For new General class operators, or those coming back into the hobby after a time away, I've found
VK3YE's [HF Primer](https://vk3ye.com/gateway/nojun96.htm) to be a great resource for getting an
overall idea of what operating on HF bands is like.

His website is also chock full of other useful information and definitely worth a visit.
