## 75th Anniversary üéÇ

Brian KJ7OX brings to our attention that this year, 2023, is the 75th anniversary
of the Lower Columbia Amateur Radio Association (founded 1948).

If you have ideas for how to mark and celebrate this anniversary, please bring
them to the LCARA Business meeting this Wednesday, or reply to this email and
let me know.

## Clubhouse Internet

Last week, LCARA switched internet providers for the clubhouse. The connection
should be noticably faster and more reliable now. The wifi network name and
password have not changed.

Please **report any issues you experience** with the internet at the clubhouse
to Glen N7UIG or Masen KF7HVM

Note: remote access to the clubhouse radio(s) is currently not operable due to
technical issues that we are in the process of working out. Remote access should
be restored in March 2023, please reply to this email if you are a remote radio
user and want more information.

## Next Week

* 02/22 Wed 1900 **LCARA Technical Committee Meeting**
* 02/25 Sat 0900 **Cowlitz ACS Exercise**
  * Details TBD. Open to all. Please RSVP if interested in participating.
