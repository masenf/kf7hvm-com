## Recap üîÅ

* 03/01 Wed **Cowlitz County ACS Meeting** at LCARA Clubhouse

### 03/04 Sat [**ARRL DX Contest SSB**](http://www.arrl.org/arrl-dx)
  
You may have noticed the HF contest over the weekend if you had a chance to
listen, all the HF bands were jam packed.  It was the "International DX Phone
Contest",  a world event.  Personally, I've only begun electronically logging
since the middle of October 2022 and in these past 4 months I'm already closing
in on 1000 Contacts in general and mostly on 10 meters!  My DX country count was
37 before this weekend and is now at 52.  This was not even working hard and I
don't have fancy HF antennas or an amplifier.  I just have a bit of wire up in
the trees and I'm having a ball!

It's fun to work a ham across the country or around the world with a simple wire
antenna.  Mine cost me about $20 to build and with a little patience you "can"
compete with the kilowatt stations and their monster beam antennas.  It's very
satisfying to know an amateur radio operator on the other side of the planet
heard 'you' louder than anyone else in the pile up for that moment in time.

This was a fun and easy contest to do from the club as the returning exchange is
only 5/9 Washington "Whiskey Alpha". Last weekend, **Rick WA7NWN** represented
**W7DG** solo from the clubhouse. However it's possible that with 3 or 4 HF
stations going up there we could work DXCC _over the weekend_ (yes, that means
100 countries). 

The following link from the ARRL is the contest calendar for the next 5 years.

#### What If I'm Not a Contester?

There are many hams who are not interested in HF contests.  Many of these hams
will simply turn off the radio for the weekend.  Others will go to **12 or 17
meters** with the hope of working other hams not part of the contest.  These bands
are known as the "WARC bands" where no contesting is permitted by the ARRL.  I got
a little tired of the contest last Saturday and slid down into the 12 meter CW
portion of the band and rattled out a satisfying QSO with a ham in the upper
midwest.  12/17 meters can be fun bands so for those of you who might consider
upgrading to General Class, now is a great time so you too can enjoy these fun
alternative bands.
