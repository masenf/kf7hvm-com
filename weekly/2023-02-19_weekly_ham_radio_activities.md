## Solar Cycle 25

Brian KJ7OX shares more about our current solar cycle.

[_NASA's solar forecast is turning out to be wrong. This team's model is still on track._](https://www.space.com/why-solar-weather-forecast-doesnt-work) from last June 2022

> Solar cycle 25 kicked off last year. Forecasters thought it would be a mild
> one, but it's turning out to be quite the opposite. From its onset, this solar
> cycle has been steadily outpacing predictions, producing more sunspots and
> spewing way more solar wind, flares and eruptions than the world's leading
> experts predicted.

### Solar Flare ‚òÄÔ∏è

Update: During the late evening of **Friday, February 17th** there was a
category X2.2 x-ray solar flare from our sun.  This is at the edge of being very
dangerous.  There was also a large (CME) Coronal Mass Ejection from the sun
which is near to earth facing.  We will likely see the fallout from this CME
around Monday the 20th.  This may manifest as communications interference of all
varieties, not to mention complete disruption in some areas.

For Amateur Radio operators this can be a mixed bag.  Charged particles can
charge the earth's **ionosphere** and bring on some great HF band conditions.  It
can also ruin things for a few days but this is temporary.  On the bright side
we may see some auroral activity this far south if the weather permits.

A few days ago the solar flux from the radio sun was about 200, after Friday
evening it jumped to 343!  That's a significant number.  The hf bands will be
hopping for a few days.  See [spaceweather.com](https://spaceweather.com/) for
current solar conditions.  The CME video may still be there. Today the sunspot
number is down to 86 but a few weeks ago it was 150.  This is due to a few
reasons.
 
The Sun rotates on its axis once in about 27 days. This rotation was first
detected by observing the motion of sunspots. The Sun's rotation axis is tilted
by about 7.25 degrees from the axis of the Earth's orbit so we see more of the
Sun's north pole in September of each year and more of its south pole in March.

This means that for a time, a maximum number of sunspots will not be earth
facing.  Not to worry, **the bands are still open every day**.

## Clubhouse Internet

In mid February 2023, LCARA switched internet providers for the clubhouse. The
connection should be noticably faster and more reliable now. The wifi network
name and password have not changed.

Please **report any issues you experience** with the internet at the clubhouse
to Glen N7UIG or Masen KF7HVM

Note: remote access to the clubhouse radio(s) is currently being tested and will
be available shortly.
