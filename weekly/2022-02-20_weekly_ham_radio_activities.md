## Tower PSA

[<img style="float: right" width=300 src="/images/weekly/2022-02-20_tower_kie.jpg">](/images/weekly/2022-02-20_tower_kie.jpg)

Last weekend **Kie (KD7UQR)** and **Rick (WA7RPM)** were taking down an HF
tower and very nearly avoided a tower collapse accident!

Not sure who needs to hear this, but **before** you work on any tower, 
it's essential to **have a plan** and do a **safety check** of all connection
points, guywires, and structures. Plan for contingencies and worst-case
scenario and ensure everyone on site understands the work and expectations.

In this case, the tower being lowered had 3 legs, one of which was intended as
a pivot point. In the pivot leg, the bolt that should have been securing the
structure to the base **was missing**, which went unnoticed. When 2 of the
three guywires were slacked, the tower could not hold itself up without the
base support and fell over, damaging the triband beam in the process.

Thankfully no one was hurt, but this is a reminder to all of the dangers
present when working on towers.
