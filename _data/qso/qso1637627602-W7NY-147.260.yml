  Bill on I5-SB in a Jeep Rubicon just passed castle rock, traveling to Medford. Calling on the 147.260,
  back to 2m after 25 years, using a homebrew wires antenna home QTH gig harbor. This is the station
  that I heard yesterday operating Aeronautical Mobile!
  
  Current rig is Icom 2300h installed above the rear view mirror. Expressed interest in getting into
  DMR via Anytone 878.
