				<div class="content">Roger, first a big thank you from me and the hundreds of people using this firmware.<br>
<br>
I am not entirely sure what the problem with the licence is, but I am confident it can be fixed. The various open source licensed were drafted to protect developments like this one and not the other way around. Can we talk about it, if necessary privately, so that a solution is found?<br>
<br>
For example: you posted that part of the firmware is closed source, as it originates from the manufacturer. I don't see this as a problem as whatever licence you chose only apply to the part you drafted and for these parts you publish the source code. The licence you chose does not apply to the parts not drafted by you, they are copyrighted by someone else (Tytera, I think?).</div>

All builds have to be removed, because a requirement of the license is that the source code (all of the source code) for the firmware be available. However this is not possible becuase 30% of the firmware file comes from the official firmware which is closed source.
</div></blockquote>
Is this really the main reason? I guess the main reason is that the source code (tar.gz, zip) is not representing compiled binaries while GPL requires this.<br>
You treat the Github just like a hosting service and that's not the open source spirit.</div>

Just stop it. Don't search for quarrel, or try to make one. When you invest years in development of such a useful software, you do what you want. Now it is not your decision to make, so don't try to argue, go make a sandwich with your username.  <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>

Thanks Roger, I'm good. I have (probably) everthing you have ever made, excluding source code, as I'm out of programing for years.<br>
<br>
As you know, I was around from the beginning, just as a beta tester, but if you still need me for further private testing - you have my email.<br>
<br>
Thank you for everything you have done for amateur radio community.</div>

I agree. The parts of the original firmware are used like an external library via wrappers.<br>

The official firmware sections are not just closed source they are hacked from a protected encrypted binary file.<br>
If the manufacturer was not chinese, and not benefiting from extra sales of their hardware, this project would have been slapped with a shutdown order a long time ago.<br>
<br>
I can't see any open source license that allows the unauthorised use of a encrypted binary without the owners permission.<br>
<br>
And forget about asking Radioddity for permission, they don't own the source code, neither do TYT. The firmware appears to be written by a separate / unknown chinese company who also writes the firmware for the DM-1801 and RD-5R.<br>
Radioddity won't tell me who this company are, its likely to be a branch of the Chinese state apparatus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW.<br>
<br>
The MD380 tools sidestepped the problem by writing a program which the user must run, to download and patch the latest official firmware, then upload to the radio<br>
<br>
But every time the manufactuerer changes the firmware download, their latest firmware needs to be reverse engineered to find the location of all the necessary functions and memory blocks, which is a huge amount of work<br>
The firmware source code e.g. linker and variables, then need to be changed to match the latest official firmware, and a new patcher program needs to be made etc<br>
<br>
I am not wasting my time going down this path, as its a supportability nightmare, and is probably why the MD380 tools project is no longer supported.</div>

				<div class="content">Just for clarification, does this mean that the CPS will no longer be able to download and install new releases of the firmware from this moment onwards?

Or you could stick with one particular version of the official firmware. Or some versions, not necessary the latest, at least not yet. If the manufacturer really insists on this type of operation, the user could load one of the supported original firmware versions. Of course it makes the process awkward, but it is possible.<br>
<br>
But you have the same problem anyway now with OpenGD77, don't you?<br>
<br>
The best option would be to negotiate with Baofeng or Radioddity. Or TYT. Even if they have not written the official firmware, they have the negotiation power to make an agreement. IMHO such an agreement would benefit them, because not all radios have option to use OpenGD77, which is the best firmware there exists!</div>
