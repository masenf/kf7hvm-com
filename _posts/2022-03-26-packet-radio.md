title: Packet Radio
---

Thanks to a local ham, Ed K7WCT, 3 club members have received new
Signalink devices and training from myself on how to configure and
use them. Unsurprisingly this has created a buzz of APRS
activity and conversations about [packet radio](/info/packet/) on
the local repeater.

So to avoid repeating myself, and also to scale my effort, I've started to put
together some information, opinions, and links on my new [AX.25 Packet
Radio](/info/packet/) info page and will continue to update that with pictures,
videos, and in-depth walkthroughs.
