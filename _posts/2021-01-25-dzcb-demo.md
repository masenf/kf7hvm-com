title: dzcb: DMR Zone Channel Builder - Overview and Demo
---

Since releasing `dzcb` last week, I've added Anytone support,
published a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfokJM5rpsM),
and updated the [walkthrough](https://github.com/mycodeplug/dzcb/blob/main/doc/WALKTHROUGH.md)
on how to generate your own customized codeplug in the cloud with Github Actions.

I haven't done extensive testing yet, but I use these generated codeplugs on
my OpenGD77, TYT MD-UV380 and wife's Anytone 878 and haven't noticed any
problems. If you find issues or have suggestions please let me know
on [github](https://github.com/mycodeplug/dzcb/issues/new), email, or leave
a comment below.
