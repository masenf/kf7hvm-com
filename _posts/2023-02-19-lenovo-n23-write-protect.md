On my last plane ride, I caught up on a paper I've been meaning to read,
[_Junkyard Computing: Repurposing Discarded Smartphones to Minimize Carbon_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06870)
and it reinvigorated my efforts to breathe a second life into [discarded
chromebooks](/2022/04/15/chromebook-for-amateur-radio) not only because they are
dirt cheap (I paid $17 per machine last week), but because they are also a
**great carbon offset**. However, my latest batch of 3 machines still had their
write protect screws in place, which means they're not immediately reusable as
x86_64 Linux laptops without popping open the case and removing a tiny screw.

So I figured I might as well record my process, for my own sake and for the
education of others following in my footsteps!
