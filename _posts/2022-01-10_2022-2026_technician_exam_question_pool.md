title: 2022-2026 Technician Exam Question Pool
---

The [NCVEC](http://www.ncvec.org/) has released the [new question pool](http://www.ncvec.org/page.php?id=373)
for the 2022 technician's exam, effective 7/01/2022 - 6/30/2026.

The training site [ham.study](http://ham.study) has provided a diff of all the questions
for your perusal: https://ham.study/diff/E2_2018/E2_2022

# My analysis

I'm still looking through the question pool and trying to understand the differences in
the added, removed, and rephrased questions. I've started posting some of the new
questions below and will update this list as I go. In the meantime, please check out
the [diff](https://ham.study/diff/E2_2018/E2_2022) provided by ham.study to see
the raw data that I'm working with.

## Added Questions

While most of the content is simply reworded or clarified from the existing material there
are a few new questions in the pool worth mentioning:

### T1 - C04

What may happen if the FCC is unable to reach you by email?

A. Fine and suspension of operator license

**B. Revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license**

C. Revocation of access to the license record in the FCC system

D. Nothing; there is no such requirement

### T1 - C07

Which of the following can result in revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license?

A. Failure to inform the FCC of any changes in the amateur station following performance of an RF safety environmental evaluation

**B. Failure to provide and maintain a correct email address with the FCC**

C. Failure to obtain FCC type acceptance prior to using a home-built transmitter

D. Failure to have a copy of your license available at your station

### T1 - D02

Under which of the following circumstances are one-way transmissions by an amateur station prohibited?

A. In all circumstances

**B. Broadcasting**
    
C. International Morse Code Practice
    
D. Telecommand or transmissions of telemetry

This question is very similar to a removed question which asked _"Under which of the following
circumstances may an amateur radio station make one-way transmissions?"_ where the correct
response was **"When transmitting code practice, information bulletins, or transmissions necessary
to provide emergency communications"**.

The primary difference seems to be pointing at the most common type of prohibited one way
transmission and implies that other types of one-way transmissions may be allowed, even if
they are not explicitly stated in the rules. While I'm speculating here, I think this may
be to reduce concerns over beacon stations and other autonomous transmitters that don't
necessarily expect a response from a single party.

### T2 - B06

What type of signaling uses pairs of audio tones?

**A. DTMF**

B. CTCSS

C. GPRS

D. D-STAR

### T2 - B12

What is the purpose of the color code used on DMR repeater systems?

**A. Establishes groups of users**

B. Defines the frequency pair to use

C. Identifies the codec used

D. Defines the minimum signal level required for access

### T2 - C02

Which of the following are typical duties of a Net Control Station?

A. Choose the regular net meeting time and frequency

B. Ensure that all stations checking into the net are properly licensed for operation on the net frequency

**C. Call the net to order and direct communications between stations checking in**

D. All these choices are correct

### T2 - C04

What is RACES?

A.An emergency organization combining amateur radio and citizens band operators and frequencies

B.An international radio experimentation society

C.A radio contest held in a short period, sometimes called a “sprint”

**D. An FCC part 97 amateur radio service for civil defense communications during national emergencies**


## Removed Questions

Overall the new question pool has a net decrease of 11 questions. The exam no longer
asks about the following topics.

### T2 - C02

What is meant by the term "NCS" used in net operation? 

### T2 - C04

What do RACES and ARES have in common?

### T2 - C06

### T2 - C07

Which of the following is an accepted practice for an amateur operator who has checked into a net?
