</a> After ramping up 2 packet nodes on the latest Raspberry Pi OS 2022-04-06 release
and struggling, I decided I'd write up the steps I followed, for my own benefit,
and that of others: [**pi4-setup**](/info/packet/pi4-setup).

It's definitely not a walkthrough and technical knowledge is assumed; however
the guide will provide a fix for `xrdp` broken out of the box, `fldigi` GPIO PTT
broken out of the box, and shortcuts and launchers for `pat` and `YAAC`.
