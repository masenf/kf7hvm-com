title: Cowlitz Ham Activity Calendar
---

Our recent silent key, Randy Greeley (NU7D), provided a weekly
newsletter / calendar with activities of interest to ham radio
operators in Cowlitz County, including nets, club meetings, and 
club-sponsored events. In his absence, I have compiled the most
recent list of recurring events to my knowledge and will
[publish a calendar](/calendar/) and ICS file containing these
events for 2022 and beyond.

Until I get everything ready and some more details hammered out,
I will not be sending out the email newsletter.

If you have any suggestions, additions, or corrections to the
calendar, either leave a comment on this post or submit an issue
or pull request to the [lcara-acs](https://github.com/masenf/lcara-acs)
repository. (The embedded calendar above will automatically update
when the underlying repo changes).
