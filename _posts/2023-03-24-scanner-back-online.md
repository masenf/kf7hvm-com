title: Scanner Back Online
---

After many months of degraded performance and neglect, I'm very happy to
announce that Rick WA7RPM and myself have successfully re-deployed the scanner
at a significantly higher location with a much better antenna. Give a listen on
[scanner.kf7hvm.com](https://scanner.kf7hvm.com) and hear what we hear!

The hardware is a Raspberry Pi 4B+ (8GB) with a [RTL-SDR dongle](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr) attached to a VHF
Station Master antenna.

The software is [ham2mon](https://github.com/madengr/ham2mon), [osmocom](https://osmocom.org), and [gnuradio](https://www.gnuradio.org). The frontend is [ham2mon-gui](https://github.com/masenf/ham2mon-gui).
